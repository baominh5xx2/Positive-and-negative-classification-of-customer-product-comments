# Positive and Negative Classification of Customer Product Comments

This project applies **PhoBERT embeddings** for feature extraction and then classifies customer comments using **SVM with different kernels** and **Logistic Regression**. The goal is to compare the classification performance across different SVM kernels and Logistic Regression.

## ðŸ“– Overview
Customer sentiment analysis is crucial for businesses to understand feedback. This project classifies **Vietnamese product reviews** into **positive** or **negative** comments using **PhoBERT embeddings** and **SVM/Logistic Regression**.

**Steps:**
1. Extract feature vectors using **PhoBERT embeddings**.
2. Train and evaluate **SVM with different kernels** (`linear`, `RBF`, `poly`) and **Logistic Regression**.
3. Using two treatments to train the model: scikit-learn library (training on CPU) and cuML to call the API of scikit-learn for training on GPU.
4. Compare accuracy and other metrics.
